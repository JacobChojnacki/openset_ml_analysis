# Anomaly Detection Methods - Laboratory

Welcome to the Anomaly Detection Methods Laboratory. This lab serves as an exploration into sophisticated techniques for identifying anomalies in datasets, alongside methodologies for discerning whether new data adheres to established distributions (novelty/out-of-distribution (OOD) detection).

## Overview

- **Part 1:** Introduction to anomaly detection methodologies and advanced techniques for OOD detection.
- **Part 2:** Application of these methodologies to representations generated by deep neural networks.

## Task

Your objective is to meticulously investigate various anomaly detection methods, as delineated in the accompanying instructional notebook, with a focus on discerning anomalies in real-world datasets.

An exemplar analysis for real-world data is showcased in the notebook **02_real_data.ipynb**.

### Procedure:

1. **Dataset Selection:** Choose 3 datasets from the repository accessible at [ODDS](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/), ensuring divergence in characteristics such as dimensionality and outlier prevalence.

2. **Method Evaluation:** For each dataset, rigorously evaluate the efficacy of anomaly detection employing 3 distinct methodsâ€”those stipulated in this guide or alternatives such as kNN. Meticulously fine-tune anomaly detector parameters to optimize method efficacy.

3. **Research Report Compilation:** Assemble a comprehensive research report comprising efficacy metrics for each method under scrutiny (ROC, AUC, FPR, TPR), alongside a meticulous examination of parameter tuning impact.

## Investigating Anomaly Detection Methods on Simulated Data

We shall explore the following methodologies for determining outlierness scores on simulated data:

- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Mahalanobis Distance
- Isolation Forest
- IRW Depth
