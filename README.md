# Anomaly Detection Methods - Laboratory

This lab serves as an exploration into techniques for identifying anomalies in datasets, alongside methodologies for discerning whether new data adheres to established distributions (novelty/out-of-distribution (OOD) detection).

## Overview

- **Part 1:** Introduction to anomaly detection methodologies and advanced techniques for OOD detection.
- **Part 2:** Application of these methodologies to representations generated by deep neural networks.

## Task

Objective is to meticulously investigate various anomaly detection methods, as delineated in the accompanying instructional notebook, with a focus on discerning anomalies in real-world datasets.

### Procedure:

1. **Dataset Selection:** Choose 3 datasets from the repository accessible at [ODDS](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/), ensuring divergence in characteristics such as dimensionality and outlier prevalence.

2. **Method Evaluation:** For each dataset, evaluate the efficacy of anomaly detection employing 3 distinct methodsâ€”those stipulated in this guide or alternatives such as kNN. Meticulously fine-tune anomaly detector parameters to optimize method efficacy.

3. **Research Report Compilation:** Assemble a report comprising efficacy metrics for each method under scrutiny (ROC, AUC, FPR, TPR), alongside a meticulous examination of parameter tuning impact.

## Investigating Anomaly Detection Methods on Simulated Data

We shall explore the following methodologies for determining outlierness scores on simulated data:

- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Mahalanobis Distance
- IRW Depth

## Installation steps:

1. Create environment

conda create -n openset python=3.10
```

2. Activate environment:

```
conda activate openset
```
